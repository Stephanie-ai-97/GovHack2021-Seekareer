# GovHack2021-Seekareer
Project Description
Australia unemployment rate is rising sharply because of COVID-19. More and more people are hired as casual staff, and some are looking for a permanent job. To facilitate both businesses and job seekers to find their ideal match, Seekareer is here to help! Compared to current job-seeking applications, Seekareer is more direct that employees can apply for multiples jobs with the same title or in the same industry. You do not need to check it one by one nor missed out on any potential job. For the Human Resources department, it reduced the cost of AI selection and integrate the hiring process. HR can see the filtered keywords as hashtag features, and it shows how candidates see themselves. By using and analyzing the datasets that the Australian government has provided, Seekareer combines the present covid situation with clear skills classification to promote the chances of getting the right people into the right workplace.
